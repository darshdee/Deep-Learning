# Deep-Learning
My deep learning projects!

This repo comprises the following!
- deeplearning.ai - This folder contains some of the programming exercises via Andrew Ng's coursera courses. These courses were extremely beneficial in building a strong foundation of neural networks and implementation using tensorflow and keras.

- My Projects
This folder comprises a variety of my personal projects I have pursued to complement my interest and passion in applying what I've learned in the field of deep learning. We will begin with the simple projects and dive deeper into the nitty grittys of the more complext projects that I undertook in order to apply my knowledge and pursue my enthusiasm for the field of deep learning!


Detailed descriptions are as follows:

Linear Regression 
BostonHousingPrices Regression Using Neural Networks: 
GOAL: Applying a one layered neural network to predict housing prices based on the example dataset
